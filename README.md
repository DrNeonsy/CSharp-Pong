## Idea
Windows Form apps are quite simple when it comes to realizing small applications. With basic C# knowledge and a bit of research, I was thinking about whether or not Pong could be a possibility within the spectrum of what Windows apps can offer. So, I tried and this is the result.

## Note
I wanted to add a background image and make it look a bit nicer, but it caused lags which I couldn't figure out fast enough. Truth be told, I did not want to put too much time into this because it is merely an experiment. Otherwise, I would've added audio effects on bounce as well. So, in the end, I went for a more classic look which you can see in the [Demo](#demo).

## How To Use

- P1 | Left Side Player
  - (W) Move Up
  - (S) Move Down

- P2
  - (ðŸ”¼) Move Up
  - (ðŸ”½) Move Down
- MISC
  - (ESC) Exit Application
  - (SPACE) Toggle Pause

The game will probably end when either side reaches a score of 99.

## Bug
If you time it right, you can get the pong ball inside a player by moving towards it while it is on the same horizontal axis.
